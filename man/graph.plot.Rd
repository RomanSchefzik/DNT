\arguments{
\item{A}{a matrix.}

\item{B}{a matrix.}

\item{methodlist}{the methods used to create the adjacency matrices.}

\item{cluster}{is the boolean value that states if the graphs shall be divided in their clusters or not.}

\item{negcol}{the color of the edges with a negative correlation value.}

\item{poscol}{the color of the edges with a positive correlation value.}

\item{caption}{the title of the pdf-file.}

\item{layout}{the layout of the networks.}

\description{
This method plots two networks to compare their differences.
}
\details{
The graphs are plotted with the same layout and other plot characteristics so that the two graphs are easy to
compare. The left network is the Survivors Admission and the right one the Survivor Event.
