Author: Roman Schefzik and Leonie Boland
Maintainer: Roman Schefzik <roman.schefzik@medma.uni-heidelberg.de>
Description: The DNT package provides a frame for testing for differences between two statistical networks based on permutation tests. Various options for network estimation (i.e. specifying the adjacency matrix) and network comparison (using several overall, node-specifc or edge-specific network difference chacteristics) are implemented. Moreover, tools for graphical illustrations and comparisons are offered.
